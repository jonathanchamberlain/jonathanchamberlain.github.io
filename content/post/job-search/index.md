With a projected graduation date of September 2024, I am currently on the job market for positions starting in Fall 2024. I am particularly interested in positions which have a focus on applied research in the fields of wireless communcation, spectrum sensing, mixed-use sharing policies, and/or applications of edge computing in wireless networks. I am open to positions within academia, industry, or government agencies. The fastest way to reach me is via my personal or Boston University affilaited emails:
