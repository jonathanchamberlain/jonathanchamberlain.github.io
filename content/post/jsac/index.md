Our work on _Facilitating Spectrum Sharing with Passive Satellite Incumbents_ has been accepted into the upcoming special issue of the IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communication on Integrated Ground-Air-Space Wireless Networks for 6G Mobile. This is work done in collaboration with [Prof Joel Johnson])(https://ece.osu.edu/johnson-joel) of the Ohio State [ElectroScience Labratory](https://electroscience.osu.edu/), focussing on the interation between commerical agents in a priority queuing system where purchasing is available as a means to jockey for position while also accomodating EESS-passive as the highest priority of user.
