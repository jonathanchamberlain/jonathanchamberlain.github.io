I will be presenting my work _Spectrum Sharing between Earth Exploration Satellite and Commercial Services: An Economic Feasibility Analysis_ at the 2024 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks in Washington DC on May 14. This work, performed with my thesis advisor [Prof. David Starobinski](https://people.bu.edu/staro/) and our collaborator [Prof. Joel Johnson](https://ece.osu.edu/johnson-joel) of Ohio State's [ElectroScience Labratory](https://electroscience.osu.edu/), is concerned with the economic potential for spectrum sharing between passive Earth Exploration Satellite Service radiometers and commerical users on High Band portions of the electromagnetic spectrum.
