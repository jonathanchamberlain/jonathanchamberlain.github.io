I will be presenting our work _Exploiting Kubernetes Autoscaling for Economic Denial of Sustainability_ at the 2025 ACM SIGMETRICS conference in Stony Brook, New York in June. This work, performed with my thesis advisor [Prof. David Starobinski](https://people.bu.edu/staro/), our undergraduate lab assistant Jilin Zheng and our collaborators [Prof. Zaoxing "Alan" Liu](https://zaoxing.github.io/) and [Zeying Zhu](https://zzylol.github.io/) of the University of Maryland Comptuer Science Department, deals with formulating Markov Decision Process-based models of Kubernetes scaling in a leader-follower game enviornment, and how varying factors contribute to the incentive to attack or not attack in terms of balance of rate of attacks vs relative cost, and balancing scaling vs SLA violations.
