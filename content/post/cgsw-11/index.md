I am serving as a member of the student organizing committee for the 11th edition of the BU Center for Information and Systems Engineering's Graduate Student Workshop, to be held [this January](https://www.bu.edu/cise/cgsw-11-0/). This student run event is one I have been previously involved with as a participant and an organizer and I am excited to be invovled with again, as it offers the BU CISE community a chance to view their peers' work and develop their presentation skills. In many cases this is a first opportunity to showcase work prior to presenting at external conferences.
