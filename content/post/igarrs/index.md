_Estimating the Retrieval Performance of Passive Remote Sensing Under Alternate Spectrum Sharing Scenarios_ has been accepted into the 2024 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium in Athens in July. This is work led by our collaborators in the Ohio State [ElectroScience Labratory](https://electroscience.osu.edu/), Nicholas Brendle and [Prof Joel Johnson])(https://ece.osu.edu/johnson-joel), focusing on technical aspects of retreival methods of Earth sensing satellites in the face of spectrum sharing which may alter availability of frequencies radiometers utilize to conduct their Brightness Temperature surveys.
