Our work, _Advancing Spectrum Sharing through Statistical Analysis of EESS-Passive Satellite Overpasses_ has been accepted into the 2025 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks in London in May. This work was led by our collaborators at the Ohio State [ElectroScience Labratory](https://electroscience.osu.edu/), Nicholas Brendle and his advisor [Prof. Joel Johnson](https://ece.osu.edu/johnson-joel) which is concerned with taking analyses of Earth Exploration Satellite Service-passive trace data and extrapolating the arrival and service patterns at multiple locations for the collection of satellites operating at the frequency of interest to derive statistical relationships between geographical location and arrival/service expectation to estimate without the need for exact information. We then take this information and consider the implications of the relation between location and the conclusions originally drawn from the previous feasibility analysis in our 2024 DySpan work to determine how location plays a role in the extent of spectrum co-existence (if one assumes commerical traffic levels consistent with the previous work are generally applicable).
