abstract: Methods for promoting flexible use of the radio frequency spectrum in microwave radiometry are examined in order to assess the potential for future spectrum sharing paradigms. Results are shown that suggest that geophysical product retrieval performance can be maintained under a variety of channel frequencies and bandwidths.
