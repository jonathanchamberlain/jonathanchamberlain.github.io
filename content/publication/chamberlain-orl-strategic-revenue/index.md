abstract: Consider a two-class unobservable priority queue, with Poisson arrivals,
  generally distributed service, and strategic customers. Customers are charged a
  fee when joining the premium class. We analyze the maximum revenue achievable under
  the non-preemptive (NP) and preemptive-resume (PR) policies, and show that a provider
  is always better off implementing the PR policy. Further, the maximum revenue under
  PR is sometimes achieved when only a fraction of the customers join the premium
  class.
