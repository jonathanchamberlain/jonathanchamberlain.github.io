abstract: "Consider an M/G/1 queuing system that supports advance reservations. In
  this system, strategic customers must decide whether to reserve a server in advance
  (thereby gaining higher priority) or forgo reservations. Reserving a server in advance
  bears a cost. The provider can further impact the customers' reservation decisions
  via implementation of one of several priority-based preemption policies: (i) one
  in which any customer is subject to service preemption by a higher priority customer
  (PR); (ii) one in which service preemption does not occur (NP); and (iii) a hybrid
  policy in which only customers without a priority reservation are subject to service
  preemption (HPR). In this work, we characterize the strategic behavior of customers,
  equilibrium outcomes, and provider's revenue maximization under each of these policies.
  In all the cases, we prove that (i) the only possible type of Nash equilibria is
  a threshold one based on the customers' priorities; and (ii) the system load impacts
  both the structure and number of Nash equilibria. We also prove that HPR is the
  only policy in which (i) an equilibrium where all customers make reservations may
  exist; and (ii) the second moment of service impacts the equilibria. Finally, we
  prove that for any system load and any service distribution, the HPR policy yields
  the highest maximum revenue, followed in turn by the PR policy and the NP policy.
  We further show that the relative difference in the performance of the HPR and PR
  policies is greatest at low system load and under low service variance."
